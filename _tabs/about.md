Hi! My name is Fujia Ren, but call me Jenny! I'm a currently a software engineer at Amazon, who loves gaming and puzzles! I graduated from Cornell University in 2020 and 2021 respectively with both a BS and MEng in Computer Science, which helped to launch my passion of computers. I'm particularly a huge fan of math and algorithms, and will frequently update this website with my personal projects/findings. I have a Siberian kitten named Zima, who is my mascot and inspiration. Cheers and happy reading!
